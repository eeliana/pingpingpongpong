## Description
Players take on either the hider or seeker role. The hider have to collect a trophy while avoiding the seeker. The seeker has to catch the hider before the hider collects the trophy. There are multiple obstacles and furnitures in the room for the hider to hide behind. Both are unable to see what are behind these obstacles but if the seeker can try to catch the hider at each obstacle. If the hider is indeed hiding behind that obstacle, the seeker will win.
